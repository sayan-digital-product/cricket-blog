Well played India!!! It was a terrific performance to see of the Aussie threat and come out as victorious in the ever important clash by 6 wickets. Credit should go to whole team, specially to the bowling group to dish out a tremeandous performance and bundle OZs out only at 199 within 49.3 overs. Indian spinners played a critical role and as expected bowled their full quota of 30 overs and have taken 6 wickets by spending just 104 runs in the process. 

### Match summary
Let's look at the summarized scorecard and top performer of the match.

##### India won by 6 wickets and 58 balls remaining

During their batting stint India had a torrid start tottering at 2-3. All three top order batters (Rohit Sharma, Ishan Kishan and Shreyas Iyer) went back to the pavillion after getting ducks. It became essential then for Virat Kohli and KL Rahul to string a partnership to take India closer to the target. 
They read the situation perfectly and played according to the merit of it. Since ball was moving a bit and Josh Hazelwood was bowling exceptionally well it wasn't very easy for batters to score quick runs. In the first 10 overs India could only score 27 runs with the loss of 3 wickets. Although the most important moment of the match occured on third delivery of the 8th over when Virat couldn't control his hook shot of a rising delivery from Hazelwood and end up top edging it. Mitchel Marsh was the fielder running towards the ball and couldn't manage to hold on to a relatively simple catch (We can argue due to misscommunication between keeper and Marsh). India could have been 20 for 4 if he could held on to it. 
Barring that single blemish, the partnership between Kohli and KL was flawless and classical in nature which dragged India out from an awkard situation.
